Kulupu is a proof of work blockchain with on-chain governance and
online upgrade.

== Overview

Kulupu is a self-updating self-governed blockchain system, using
proof-of-work as its consensus engine.Kulupu is built with the
link:https://github.com/paritytech/substrate[Substrate framework]. It
is one of the first blockchains that combine proof-of-work consensus
engine with forkless upgrades.

It has all the normal features you'd expect in a proof of work
blockchain.

* *No pre-mine.* Kulupu was launched in September 2019, with 0 coin in
   its genesis block. It then emits 1 KLP per second to miners, till
   today.
* *ASIC-resistant.* Kulupu uses the battle tested RandomX mining algorithm from Monero.
* Like any decentralized blockchain system, it is censorship
  resistant, accessible to everyone, peer-to-peer and permission-less.

In addition, Kulupu contains several unique features:

* *On-chain governance and forkless upgrade.* Kulupu has an on-chain
   democracy system. Users and a democratically elected council can
   submit referendum proposals, which are voted by coin holders. This
   user-driven governance system allows Kulupu to enact runtime
   upgrade much more easily, and with much reduced risk of network
   split, compared with hard-fork-based governance systems. The same
   system also allows upgrading the consensus, including mining
   algorithm and difficulty adjustment algorithm.
* *Voluntary taxation and treasury.* A democracy governance system
   allows Kulupu to build a public-good treasury system, with coin
   holders having the final say on how funds are spent. The treasury
   taxation is fair, and at the same time voluntary, reducing the risk
   of centralization and misuse.
* *Actor-based smart contract.* Actor-based smart contract aims at
   solving some of the outstanding issues in normal call-based smart
   contract system, improving backward compatibility, fee payment and
   other areas.
* *Interoperability with Polkadot.* By using Substrate, building on
   the same framework that Polkadot is built on, Kulupu allows easy
   interoperaibility with Polkadot in the future.
