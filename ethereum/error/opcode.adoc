Issues and fixes for opcode specific error handling.

EVM and its feature upgrades are designed and developed by different
people, with different understanding of how the system
works. Overtime, inconsistencies in error handling appear. They create
confusions for implementors. As a result, when account versioning is
deployed, it may also be good to fix those inconsistencies once and
for all.

## Check Arithmetic Overflow

*Proposals: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1051[EIP-1051]*

This cleans up the long-standing issue that arithmetic opcodes in EVM
silently warps when overflowing. This has turned out to be a security
issue, with known exploit happened in the past.

== Consistent copy-to-memory behavior
[spec]
id: 47-CPYM
discuss: https://github.com/corepaper/corepaper/issues/2

Some opcodes requires copying data into EVM memory. Overtime,
inconsistent behavior appears. Some opcodes will panic if the offset
of the data is out of range, while some other opcodes will silently
assume that the data is zero. This specification attempts to make it
consistent, by changing all opcodes to panic.

=== Specification

Change the behavior of the following opcodes:

* In `CALLDATALOAD`, if `stack(0) + 32` overflows or is greater than
  the length of call data, return unrecoverable error.
* In `CALLDATACOPY`, if `stack(1) + stack(2)` overflows or is greater
  than the legnth of call data, return unrecoverable error.
* In `CODECOPY`, if `stack(1) + stack(2)` overflows or is greater than
  the length of code, return unrecoverable error.
* In `EXTCODECOPY`, if `stack(2) + stack(3)` overflows or is greater
  than the length of external code, return unrecoverable error.

=== Interactions

This assumes that we have a *forward-compatible EVM* that is deployed
to support *unrecoverable error*, such as
https://specs.corepaper.org/39-ungas[39-UNGAS].

=== Discussions

This specification does not change the behavior of `CALL`, `CALLCODE`,
`DELEGATECALL` and `STATICCALL`, which copy data from return data
buffer to memory. It has a specific behavior that the length copied is
`min(stack(out_len), buffer_len)`.

== Explicit memory growth
[spec]
id: 48-GROWM
discuss: https://github.com/corepaper/corepaper/issues/2

Current EVM silently grows memory, whenever a higher region is
accessed. While this design does not have apparent downside, it
slightly complicates analysis of a program and implementation of EVM,
in that the total memory used is implicit. In this specification, we
explore ways to use new opcodes `GROWMEMORY` to make memory growth
explicit.

=== Specification

Add opcode `GROWMEMORY` (`0xfd`). It pops one item `target` from the
stack. The instruction charges `G_BASE` and then sets the total
available memory size to `target`. It then charge gas cost according
to current rules for memory cost. If `target` is smaller than the
current memory size, the instruction will shrink the memory, but will
not refund any gas. If the gas cost charge fails, return out-of-gas
error.

Remove checks and charges of memory gas for the following opcodes.
Add an additional check for each of them in relation with current
memory size, and return unrecoverable error if the check fails.

* For `SHA3`, `RETURN`, `REVERT`, `LOG`, check `stack(0) + stack(1)
  <= memory_len`.
* For `CODECOPY`, `CALLDATACOPY`, `RETURNDATACOPY`, check `stack(0) +
  stack(2) <= memory_len`.
* For `EXTCODECOPY`, check `stack(1) + stack(3) <= memory_len`.
* For `MLOAD`, `MSTORE`, check `stack(0) + 32 <= memory_len`.
* For `MSTORE8`, check `stack(0) + 1 <= memory_len`.
* For `CREATE`, `CREATE2`, check `stack(1) + stack(2) <= memory_len`.
* For `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, check `stack(3) + stack(4) <= memory_len`
  and `stack(5) + stack(6) <= memory_len`.
* For `DELEGATECALL`, `STATICCALL`, check `stack(2) + stack(3) <=
  memory_len` and `stack(5) + stack(6) <= memory_len`.

=== Interaction

Note that after https://specs.corepaper.org/39-ungas[39-UNGAS],
out-of-gas error will be an unrecoverable error.
