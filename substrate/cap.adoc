[meta=description]
Capability-based runtime modules for Substrate is an
alternative design of Substrate Runtime Module Libraries. It aims at
incorporating some capability-based system into runtime, to address
some concerns on upgradability and security.

The core idea of capability-based runtime modules is that instead of
modules compiled in one single binary and communicating directly
through internal calls, we design a root OS-like runtime. Each
function modules are compiled individually as its own binary and only
talk with the root OS-like runtime. The root OS-like runtime then
handles communications with other modules through capatibilities.

== Rationale

The design of Substrate Runtime Module Libraries has significantly
simplified runtime development for blockchains. In the mean time, we
do still hear concerns regarding certain aspects of the current
system:

* There are very little separation of different runtime modules. This
  brings in some security concerns, as any flaw in a single runtime
  module will be a flaw for all runtime modules.
* Democracy module is currently designed to update all aspects of the
  blockchain using the same rule. This sometimes does not represent
  the real needs, as in a law system, certain aspects (like the
  constitution) should be much harder to change than others. We cannot
  yet express this in the current model.
* Currently, even if we only need to modify a single runtime module,
  we still need to replace the whole runtime binary. This is not an
  ideal situation.
* It is not always clear for users regarding the influences of its
  funding when sending out transactions. The documentations usually
  point it out clearly, but still, there is nothing on-chain that can
  allow users to state clearly if it is willing to give the ability to
  runtime modules to slash or transfer the balances.

Capability-based runtime modules address those issues by:

* Creating a root runtime. The root runtime acts as the "OS kernel" of
  the whole runtime. All function runtime modules are sandboxed and
  have their own child storage.
* Provide any runtime modules the ability to define custom
  capatibilities, and pass those capatibilities to other modules for
  operations.
* Provide users the ability to define their own capatibilities as
  well. For example, "may slash X coins" or "may lock X coins". Users
  pass those capatibilities as signed in a transaction, to parameters
  of runtime module calls.

== Design

=== Root runtime and process modules

The *root runtime* is the runtime that is directly operated by
Substrate. *Process modules* are function runtime modules that is
operated by the root runtime.

The root runtime stores WebAssembly binaries of all process modules,
and upon each block, execute each process module one by one in the
sandboxed WebAssembly environment. The sandboxed environment does not
have the full storage access of the blockchain. Instead, it is only
limited to a standalone child storage.

=== Capability and invocation

A *capability* has three items, the *owner*, the *process module*
who created this capability, and the *capability data*. An
*invocation* of a capability will execute a function call and
consumes it. The invocation, besides passing the capability, also
passes a *function name* and some *parameters*. This is to allow the
sender to indicate how it wants to spend the capability. If a
capability is repeatable, then the invocation may return new
capatibilities. For example, a `balance::slashable(address, 100)`
capability can be invoked with `slash(90)`, and if successful, it
will return a new capatibilty `balance::slashable(address, 10)`.

Note that a capability may become dangling, if an incompatible
process module upgrade is enacted. The root runtime will make sure
that capatibilies cannot be modified, but it's the process module's
job to check whether a capability is valid.

In an invocation, parameters to a function call can also be
capatibilities. The capatibilities will be passed by root runtime from
the sender to the receiver. The receiver can then store this
capability for future use, to do invocations that it would otherwise
not be able to do.

Capatibilities can also be created by user transactions. Those are
created through a special method call in process modules and can only
be invoked by root runtime. A user transaction can contain a
`requests` field that has a capability `balance::slashable(address,
100)`. The root runtime will pass this capability to be checked by
`balance` module, indicating that it is signed by the user. It creates
this capability if the request is valid. Otherwise, the whole user
transaction will fail directly.

A capability cannot be copied by itself. Any duplicable capability
will have a function call `duplicate` that can split the current
capability to two.

=== Process module lifecycle

Each process module now has a lifecycle.

Upon initialization, the system module will pass two system
capatibilities to the process module -- `system::upgradable(module)`
which will allow the process module to upgrade itself, and
`system::destroy(module)` which will allow the process module to
self-destruct.

Note that it is solely up to the process module if it is upgradable or
destroyable. If it plans to be, then it should duplicate those two
capatibilities and pass them to a democracy module.

== Example

* For an upgradable process module, upon initialization, it receives
  the two system capatibilities `system::upgradable(module)` and
  `system::destory(module)`. The initialization parameter also
  requires a capability with interface `push(<any capability>,
  <rule>)` and `clear()`, which is supposed to point to a democracy
  module, for example, `democracy::votable(id)`. The module then
  pushes `system::upgradable(module)` along with other votable
  capatibilities to democracy module. The democracy module presents
  users with lists of capatibilities that it receives, and users can
  vote to invoke those capatibilities under their specified rules.
* For staking module, users, in their transactions, first specify a
  capability request `balance::slashable(X)`. The extrinsic is then
  set to `staking::bound(balance::slashable(X))`.

== Implementation

A viable way to implement capability-based runtime modules is to
implement it as a SRML module. The root runtime becomes a normal
modules that controls many sandboxed submodules.
