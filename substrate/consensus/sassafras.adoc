This article contains some notes about the Sassafras consensus engine.

Sassafras is also known as "BADASS BABE" or "SASSY". Developed by Jeff
Burdges, Alistair Stewart, Sergey Vasilyev and others, it aims at
fixing some short-comings of BABE and thus making the Polkadot network
more secure.

== Sassafras via Schnorrkel

This is a simplified version of Sassafras, directly using
Schnorrkel. This is mostly used as an intermediate process towards
Sassafras via Ring VRF, and thus does not have the same strong
security properties as Sassafras. The overall process works as follows:

1. At epoch stem:[N], each validator generates schnorrkel VRFs `(VRFOutput,
   VRFProof)`, select those `H_1(VRFOutput)` passing the threshold, and
   send them to `H_2(VRFOutput)`.
2. At epoch stem:[N+1], each validator publishes the VRFs they received,
   directly as transactions on-chain.
2.1. Runtime does not validate the VRF. Rather, it is validated by
   consensus engine at the end of the block. Invalid VRFs are
   simply ignored.
2.2. The reason for publishing as transactions is for future reward
   system extension, which will be handled by runtime, and for reuse
   of transaction pool.
3. At the end block of epoch stem:[N+1], consensus sorts the VRF gathered
   as this epoch, using "outside-in" order.
4. The block proposers at epoch stem:[N+2] will be VRFs produced above.
